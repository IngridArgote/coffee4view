# â˜• Coffee4View: Automated Detection of Coffee Fruit Ripeness Stages

Coffee4View is a MATLAB-based image analysis pipeline for detecting, classifying, and counting coffee fruits by maturity stage. It is designed for small-scale image acquisition environments (e.g., 50Ã—50 px images captured in field conditions) and follows a multi-stage algorithm inspired by recent research in agricultural computer vision.

## ðŸš€ Pipeline Overview

1. **Threshold Generation**
   - `generateThresholdsAllClasses.m` analyzes image patches by class and extracts Q1/Q3 values per color channel (RGB, HSV, Lab, YCbCr) to determine optimal segmentation thresholds.

2. **Mask Refinement**
   - `refineWhiteMask.m` removes residual background noise from white-dominant areas using morphological operations, improving segmentation quality.

3. **Multiclass Segmentation**
   - `segmentAllClasses.m` combines weighted candidate channels for each class using thresholds and produces a global mask with all fruit regions.

4. **Edge Detection and Ellipse Projection**
   - `detectEdgesZeroCrossing.m`: Applies a Laplacian of Gaussian filter and detects zero-crossings.
   - `findCurvedArcs.m`: Extracts arc segments and identifies inflection points.
   - `projectEllipsesFromArcs.m`: Projects elliptical shapes from arc endpoints and central curvature for fruit estimation.

5. **Full Pipeline Execution**
   - `runFullPipeline.m`: End-to-end execution script including threshold loading, segmentation, edge detection, ellipse fitting, and fruit count output.

## ðŸ“Š Output

- **Binary masks** for each class
- **Segmented RGB images** with isolated fruit
- **Ellipses projected** on detected arc contours
- **CSV and `.mat` files** with quartile data, thresholds, and segmentation scores

---

## ðŸ§  Technical Highlights

- **Color space analysis**: Uses a quartile-based method across 12 channels (R, G, B, H, S, V, L, a, b, Y, Cb, Cr) to select optimal segmentation bands.
- **Noise-tolerant masking**: Incorporates contrast enhancement and refined morphological filtering to reject white background noise.
- **Elliptical modeling**: Incorporates geometric arc detection and angle-based filtering (using Î± angle thresholds) to approximate fruit contours even when not fully closed.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This project is currently under academic development and might evolve further with improved arc tracing and dataset generalization.
- Works best with small-sized high-contrast coffee fruit images in controlled background settings.
